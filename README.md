You likely already have the *Java Runtime Environment* installed on your machine and will not need to download this package.

However, should you have difficulties running *CodeCarnage*, please see https://java.com/en/download/ .

### Windows

1. Clone our git repository (if you are unsure how to clone a git repository, please see https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ .)

3. Double-click the ***CodeCarnage-all.jar*** file.
4. Play!

### Linux and Mac

1. Clone our git repository (if you are unsure how to clone a git repository, please see https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ .)

        java -jar CodeCarnage-all.jar

### Other Devices

If you cannot access a Linux Device, we recommend using a Virtual Environment with Fedora, as this is a tested environment.
To do this, see http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Fedora-17-in-Virtualbox (while the article is slightly outdated, the procedure is extremely similar).

You could also try to follow the **Linux and Mac** instructions at your own risk.
